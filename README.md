# CS145-Lab4
Files for the fourth lab for CS 145 W25
This lab uses stacks in order to create a deck of cards and play the game Blackjack.
Bugs to note: The card value does not correspond with the dealt card and seems to be assigned randomly. Additionally, the scores are calculated within the playerDeal and compDeal methods, but those scores do not get properly returned to the main method.
